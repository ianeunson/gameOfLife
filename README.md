# gameOfLife

This will be my first little project based on John Conway's Game of Life. 
I will be drawing much of my inspiration from this website: https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/(23,5)c;79_Herschel_climber but I will try to code it completely on my own. 
I will start with a basic version that allows users to start/stop and toggle squares. 
Eventually I will include a speed controller/slider, size of map controller/slider as well as prebuilt objects
